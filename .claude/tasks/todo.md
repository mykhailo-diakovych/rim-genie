## Part 3: Architecture Notes

### Resolved Design Decisions

1. **Invoice items**: ✅ Decided — Copy from quote items (snapshot). Implemented in `createFromQuote` service.
2. **"Send to Technician" enforcement**: ✅ Backend role-guard via `cashierProcedure`. UI hiding still needed on floor manager page.
3. **VIP discount**: ✅ Auto-applied at invoice conversion time (not at quote time per spec request).

### Remaining Design Decisions

1. **Multi-site**: Add `siteId` to all tables or use a junction? → Recommend FK on quote/invoice/job (Phase 6.4)
2. **Discount workflow**: Inline on invoice or separate approval entity? → Recommend separate `discountRequest` table for audit trail (Phase 6.3)

### Technical Debt / Improvements

- ~~Technician, Cashier pages use hardcoded mock data~~ → ✅ Both now wired to real API
- ~~Accept dialog technician dropdown hardcoded~~ → ✅ Now loads from `technicians.list` API
- Dashboard metrics currently use mock/calculated data — need real aggregation queries
- Inventory page still uses hardcoded mock data
- No real-time updates yet (polling could be interim via TanStack Query refetchInterval)
- No file upload infrastructure (Azure Blob Storage needed for proof-of-work videos)
- `acceptedById`/`completedById` audit columns missing from job table

### Security Gaps to Address

- "Send to Technician" is backend-enforced ✅ but still visible in Floor Manager UI ❌
- Authorization before changes/deletions (audit log system) — not implemented
- Customer deletion validation (check for existing invoices/jobs) — not implemented
